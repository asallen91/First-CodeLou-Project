            <p class="about-content">
                Isolation Tank Ensemble is an instrumental band from Louisville, KY currently comprised of 5 members dedicated to bringing together classical instruments along side modern style music and out of the ordinary time signatures, creating a new sound they like to call "Trash Prog". The band is currently working towards writing and recording their first album and they hope to have a few demo tracks available for an EP soon.
